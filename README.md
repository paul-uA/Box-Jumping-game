Simple Browser game
A version of the T-rex game in chrome 

![](wireframe4game.png)

above is a quick drawing of the most basic version of the game.
the box appears to move to the left and triangles are blocvk its path and you need to jump over them.
 
 The time at the the top left shows how long the game is running as well as serving as a score.
 the start box will contain a simple start button

 if this is completed then more features will be added. (such as)
 game messages (win, lose, current high score ...... and so on )
 reset button on loss of game maybe in a modal?
 add more traingles aat random and maybe objects to duck under?
 sounds
